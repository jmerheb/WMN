## Description

This project is a web application designed to facilitate chat and group message features using SMS while maintaining privacy of the users phone number. This application uses React, JavaScript, Python, Material UI, Cloud Firestore and Twilio.

When first loading the web app, the user is prompted with the login page to keep all client data secure.

</p>

Once logged in, the main page is shown. All existing groups are on the left-side, and all client contacts are on the right-side. Buttons on the top of the page displayed allow the user to create/delete new groups or clients.

When creating a new client, a dialog window will be displayed in the UI. The user will then be prompted to input the name and phone number of their new client. Once the user clicks create, the client will be displayed on the main page.

When creating a new group, a dialog window will be displayed in the UI. The user will then be prompted to create a name for the new group, and also check off all the clients that they want to be included in it. Once the user clicks create, the group name will be displayed on the main page.

</p>

After the user messages a group or client, the message is displayed on their UI along with all the other messages they have sent. On the client's end, the message will be recieved as an SMS from a phone number that is generated by Twilio. The user's real phone number is kept private from all of their clients.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
